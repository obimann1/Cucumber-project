A Selenium Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) Automation Script based on the Cucumber Framework using the Free CRM e-commerce website.

Some of the Popular Automation Frameworks are:
  Module Based Testing Framework
  Library Architecture Testing Framework
  Data Driven Testing Framework
  Keyword Driven Testing Framework
  Hybrid Testing Framework
  Behavior Driven Development Framework
  
  There are different tools available for BDD like cucumber, Jbehave etc.Behavior Driven Development framework allows automation of functional validations in easily readable and understandable format to Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, etc. Such frameworks do not necessarily require the user to be acquainted with the programming language. 
  The BDD Framework employs use of a plain descriptive English grammar to outline the functional requirements that are to be validated. These test are described as a behaviour of the system and are more user focussed. 
  This in turn makes it easier for collaboration amongst stakeholders like Users, Business Analysts, Testers and Developers.
  
  Cucumber is a testing framework which supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It lets us define application behavior in plain meaningful English text using a simple grammar defined by a language called Gherkin.
  With the help of Gherkin language cucumber helps facilitate the discovery and use of a ubiquitous language within the Development team. 
  Tests written in cucumber are written in a language that is quite easy to understand by the business stakeholders. 
  Cucumber test removes many misunderstandings long before they create any ambiguities in to the code.
